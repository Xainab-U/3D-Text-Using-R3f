# 3D-Text-Using-R3f

The objective was to develop an interactive application using React Three Fiber (R3f) to display and manipulate 3D text within a Three.js scene. This application allows users to create custom 3D text, modify its properties, and export it in various 3D model formats.

Utilized fontLoader and Drei 3D text components to display text within the Three.js scene.  Incorporated multiple font styles that users can select from to apply to the 3D text. Enabled users to change the properties of the 3D text, including Transparency, Color, Scale, Font size, Height and Position.
Developed a user input interface to allow the creation of custom 3D text.Added a user interface for controlling the basic properties of the 3D text, such as size, color, and font selection.

Provided options to save and export the 3D text in various formats (GLB, GLTF, OBJ, STL), making it compatible with applications that support 3D graphics, such as Blender.
