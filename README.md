# 3D-Text-Using-R3f
The objective was to develop an interactive application using React Three Fiber (R3f) to display and manipulate 3D text within a Three.js scene. This application allows users to create custom 3D text in 3 different languages, modify its properties, and export it in various 3D model formats.
